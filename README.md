## 🔭 What is NebulaHub?
NebulaHub is a compact Roblox ScriptHub intended as a place to load and run pre-made scripts. It ships with a simple loader and a minimal interface so you can quickly get started.

## ⚠️ Requirements
- A **compatible Roblox executor** is required to run NebulaHub.  
  *Note:* The project requires an executor that supports the APIs used by the loader and scripts. Compatibility varies by executor; consult your executor's documentation for supported features and versions.
- Use NebulaHub responsibly and in accordance with the Roblox Terms of Service and the rules of the games you join. Do not use it to harm, harass, or cheat in ways that violate other users' rights or platform rules.

## 🚀 Quick start
Place `Loader.lua` in your executor or run it through your preferred loader.

### 🔌 Loader.lua
```lua
print("Almost Done")
```
